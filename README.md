# Export_UCS_Inventory
 PowerShell Scripts to Export UCS Inventory
 HTML Script is based on https://github.com/smitmartijn/Cisco-UCS-Inventory-Script, but has been updated to include a central AES encryption key for a shared user account password for UCS
 XLSX Script is based on same base code, but instead of exports to XLSX so that users can use the data operationally
 
 Simply run script and fill in blanks for UCS FQDN and input user account with access to UCS. I do recommend use of a read-only user account for this process.
